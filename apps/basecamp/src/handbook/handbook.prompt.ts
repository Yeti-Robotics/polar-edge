________________
Overview 
Welcome to YETI Robotics and the Queen City Robotics Alliance (QCRA)! 
This handbook is the YETI Robotics guide, a list of requirements and expectations for all participating students, mentors, volunteers, and parents. 
If you are a returning student, please reference the Requirements and Need to Know sections to denote changes from last season. 
All members are responsible for knowing the content within this guide, as it will answer most questions regarding our team's operation. 
Introduction
YETI Robotics is part of the FIRST Robotics Competition with the official designation FIRST Robotics Competition Team 3506, YETI Robotics.
  

FIRST is a K-12 program with the capstone being the FIRST Robotics Competition (or FRC for short) for high school students.  
FRC is best described as: 
The Ultimate Sport for the Mind TM
“Under strict rules and limited time and resources, teams of high school students are challenged to build industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game in alliance with other teams, while also fundraising to meet their goals, designing a team “brand,” and advancing respect and appreciation for STEM within the local community.”
	First has an outstanding reputation for advancing students. 92% of FIRST participants express interest in attending college, universities provide over $80 million in scholarships for the programs, and the experiences learned along the way are lifelong skills that prepare them for the real world.
What do students get out of this program? Members learn problem solving, teamwork, leadership, communication, and collaboration on a professional level alongside those adult experts in a staggering array of career fields. 
The YETI Team is structured with a student leadership group and many different functions or jobs for students to participate in, such as engineering, Computer Aided Design (CAD), outreach, programming, electrical wiring, business/finance, photography, graphic design, marketing, leadership, and writing.
YETI is a part of the Queen City Robotics Alliance and calls the FIRST Zone - Charlotte home.  This collaborative facility nestled inside the heart of Charlotte is a one-of-a-kind robotics fabrication lab complete with machine shop and regulation-size fields for all levels of FIRST Robotics.
The YETI community is not only about building robots; we build robots to build character and make an impact on the community.
________________


Requirements and Need to Know
To join and participate in YETI Robotics, there are some minimum requirements and expectations each member must meet.
For new members, read this entire handbook and then complete the checklist below!  Returning members, start below: 
You can use this section as a checklist to completely join or return to the team for another season.  They are split into these sections:
1. Forms and Communication
2. Fees/Fundraising Requirements
3. Outreach
4. Attendance and Competitions
1 - Forms and Communication
YETI Robotics uses Discord and Google Groups to communicate as a team.  Members have to be on these platforms and should seek access to these two methods of communication first.  The admin for Google Groups is Iaiela Dumitrescu, who can add members. Any current member of Yeti Robotics can invite members to the Discord channel!
After being added to the communication groups, you must complete the team forms on Google:
* Student Application/Parent/Mentor Application https://forms.gle/wSv3j8HKALLUsa1s9
* QCRA Contact Information Form

* Medical Emergency Form & Insurance Cards https://forms.gle/GiR1UmdkRGTha4bD9
* Sign up with the team on FIRSTinspires.org and complete all required signatures once you receive an invitation email from donotreply@firstinspires.org 
* Sign the digital acknowledgement that you have read the student/parent/mentor expectations, the rules in the handbook, and have completed the requirements checklist.
 2 - Fees and Fundraising Requirements
There are two types of fees to be aware of at YETI Robotics. Below are the details for these two fees: 
   * Non-refundable $300 Registration fee due with application and before  September 12th, 2025. (The fee increases to $400 if paid after)
   * Minimum of $1750 in fundraising goals met before February 26, 2026
   * IF PAYING COMPLETELY OUT OF POCKET IT IS $2500 before February 26, 2026 split in 3 equal payments with HARD DEADLINES
What do these fees get you? 
   * Any team member who pays the Registration Fee may attend all team meetings and training events for Team YETI at The Zone.
   * Any team member who pays the Registration Fee may also participate in Build Season at The Zone. Failure to meet the two fundraising requirements to meet the Team Budget means the student will not get to participate in the competitions.
All fees paid to the team are non-refundable. The money gets spent to pay for tooling, robots, travel, services, and materials that make this program possible. Details about team finances will be discussed later in the handbook. 
Additional details around fundraising that students and parents need to know: 
   * It is not the intention of this program for students to pay out of pocket! We want students to pursue their requirements through merit, such as donating time to the programs or through fundraising activities! 
● Students can and are strongly encouraged to raise these costs! A specific mentor and a student lead are assigned to assist students with fundraising efforts.
● YETI offers training in how to fundraise by contacting companies. Of course, each student can fundraise in their own way. 
● The Fundraising Year runs from May 1 for one year to April 30 of the next year. Any funds received after April 30 intended for the previous season will be counted towards the next season. 
● A commitment is defined as a promise, note, or email from a company. A pledge is a written agreement from a donor company that guarantees funds will be received in the appropriate time frame. (Mrs. Iaiela NEEDS to be copied on all communication with the sponsor to help with these steps). 
● Donated robot building materials count if the student brings in an estimate from the donor company stating the value of materials donated, and this value is approved by a mentor (Robbie Hoyler). 
Additional Costs
Food: Students will pay for their food before the competition season begins for all three events at one time to minimize the need to constantly ask for/collect money. Mrs. Iaiela will collect funds and purchase lunches. The team will pay for one dinner at each tournament.
3 - Outreach Requirements
At YETI, students are encouraged to seek, coordinate, and lead new outreach events that seek to spread the message and program of FIRST and STEM in the community.  This is an important part of the team identity.
   * YETI challenges each team member to log 50 hours for rookies and 100 hours for veterans for Outreach.
4 - Attendance and Competition Requirements
Attendance and Competition requirements are the last category of team requirements for students to enjoy the full experience of the team.  Attendance is tracked through the QCRA QR code system posted at all the entryways in the Zone. Students are expected to sign in and out of this system to track their attendance.




To compete with the team at competitions, students must:
   * Exhibit one of the core tenets of FIRST Robotics - Gracious Professionalism.
   * What is Gracious Professionalism? - It's a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions.
   * FIRST Core Values
   * Discovery: We explore new skills and ideas.
   * Innovation: We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.
   * Impact: We apply what we learn to improve our world.
   * Inclusion: We respect each other and embrace our differences.
   * Teamwork: We are stronger when we work together.
   * Fun: We enjoy and celebrate what we do!
   * 75% of 390 Hours: Attendance is required of students and mentors at weekly meetings between August 1st and April 30th. The schedule is posted on the team calendar online at yetirobotics.org, and a general season calendar is posted in the Season section later in this handbook.  Attending meetings between May-August during the offseason positively benefits team attendance hours!  Travel expenses will not be covered by the team for those not meeting these requirements, and you are not going to be traveling with the team; rather, if you wish, you will travel with your parents.
   * Student Leadership Attendance requirements: 85% of meetings, attend Kick Off, and ALL tournaments.
   * Dress code must be followed at all YETI events and activities.
   * MEET ALL REQUIREMENTS LISTED ABOVE
________________
Expectations and Safety Rules
YETI Robotics participates in a lot of activities for which there are general expectations and safety rules in place that all team members must be aware of.
This section of the handbook is split into sections for which all members are fully responsible for following:
1 - Student Expectations
   1. Exhibits Gracious Professionalism (GP) at all times and at all events.
   1. No tolerance for ethnic, gender, religious, or age degradation
   2. Respect all students, parents, mentors, and volunteers.
   3. Treat YETI activities like a professional work environment 
   2. Two deep rule: Two students or two mentors present whenever mentors and students are in the same room.
   3. NO HORSEPLAY - AT ANY TIME!
   4. Balance YETI with other activities.  Students are expected to actively participate in all activities throughout the year, i.e., no playing games/talking on cell phones, doing homework on the clock, or doing any other unrelated activity at any YETI events. 
   5. Students are expected to sign in for attendance using the QCRA QR code system posted at all entryways and sign out.
   6. Students interested in leadership positions will have to apply for an interview for the desired positions/jobs.
   7. Students are encouraged to float between different divisions of the team until build season begins to try multiple aspects of the team and become well-rounded.
   8. All students should attend at least one complete multi-day competition. 
   9. Maintain passing grades scholastically.
   10. Team etiquette online and via mobile must be upheld. Taking disrespectful photos, sending offensive material, and posting cringeworthy content online are not a part of YETI culture.
   11. Student automobile drivers are to obey all rules of the road, drive modestly, and are only allowed to park where designated when on QCRA property.  The FIRST Zone is in a busy manufacturing district with large trucks, so security is very strict and, in some cases, governed by Federal regulations. Failure to comply with YETI's vehicle regulations will result in students losing the privilege of driving to the Zone.  If necessary, Mentors will review the video of the parking lot with QCRA and share it with parents.  Additionally, if needed, the student car will be towed from the Zone at the owner's expense. Being obnoxious with the car stereo, doing burnouts, and driving recklessly count as failure to comply.  General safety for the area dictates that all vehicles should remain locked and personal property stowed out of sight to deter theft or damage to a vehicle.  
   12. All suspicious actions or crimes should be reported immediately to a mentor.
   13. YETI acknowledges that relationships occur on the team, and this is natural.  However, PDA (Public Displays of Affection) are NOT appropriate at the Zone. 
2 - Parent Expectations
   1. Exhibits Gracious Professionalism (GP) at all times and at all events.
   1. No tolerance for ethnic, gender, religious, or age degradation
   2. Respect all students, parents, mentors, and volunteers as they are here to let your student learn.
   2. Inform Iaiela Dumitrescu, or Robbie Hoyler, of any academic or personal issues that may interfere with son/daughter participating fully with the team.  This includes emotional or learning disabilities, especially if it involves a student needing to take medication.  YETI is willing to work with anyone and may require parents to participate and help if needed.
   3. Make sure your student understands all team expectations and review them with their school schedule and other activities.
   4. Turn all documentation in on time and sign up for events and meals to assist with the team functionality. 
   5. Parents are encouraged to be involved with the operation of the team however, the leadership of the team has final discretion with the direction of the program.


3 - Mentor Expectations
   1. Exhibits Gracious Professionalism (GP) at all times and at all events.
   1. No tolerance for ethnic, gender, religion, age degradation
   2. Respect all students, parents, mentors, and volunteers.
   2. Two deep rule: Two students or two mentors present whenever mentors and students are in the same room.
   3. Provide a safe, fun, creative environment to guide learning for the students.
   4. Conduct yourself professionally as an example for students to emulate.
   5. Complete FIRST Youth Protection Program background check.
   6. Mentors must pass a 1-year probationary period to be invited back to mentor.
   7. Sign FIRST consent and release forms online yearly.
   8. Ensure students do not leave events early before the team is ready to depart.


________________
Safety for Team, Shop, Robots, and Competition
1 - FIRST and YETI Robotics Youth Protection Program (YPP)
   1. Mentors will complete FIRST's YPP Training and background check, including the Youth Protection Program Screening, following FIRST guidelines.
   2. YETI Robotics as a team will review the YPP and watch the video within the first 6-8 weeks of the start of fall meetings. Parents are invited to participate.
   3. Any students and parents not present will be asked to review the video on their own time.
   4. YETI Robotics will follow the rule of two, meaning at least two mentors are present with any students in a team gathering, OR two or more students are present in a room with any one mentor.  NO one-on-one unless the student and mentor are related as parent and child.
   5. Information on the FIRST Youth Protection Program can be found here:  http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-protection-policy
   6. YETI Robotics runs as a separate entity from FIRST.  All final decisions on safety, conduct, and support are at the final discretion of team leadership.
   7. All safety and conduct incidents should be reported immediately, where possible, but certainly within 48 hours by all involved, including any witness reports.
   8. Adult team leadership may conduct interviews to better understand any incidents that occur.
   9. All incidents of a serious nature should be reported to Iaiela Dumitrescu or Robbie Hoyler.  For additional coverage and support, YETI Robotics is a part of the Queen City Robotics Alliance, and there is a support function for teams there as well.
2 - Apparel - What to wear?
   1. YETI Robotics team members should dress casually and professionally as you would wear to a job.
   2. Close-toe shoes must be worn to all YETI functions and events that involve robots or the shop.  To prevent injury and shavings from entering your shoes, we recommend high-top shoes with no openings with long pants that drape over the shoes.  Avoid crocs, high heels, sandals, or any open shoes.
   3. Safety Glasses must be worn in the shop area or around robots!  The glasses must be ANSI Z187.1 compliant and marked on the lenses or frame.  Tinted glasses are ok if your eyes can be seen through the lenses.
   4. Prescription lenses are not safety glasses.  If you wear glasses, you may wish to purchase larger z187 glasses that cover your regular lenses.  Side shields are allowed at competitions, but are not recommended by YETI.
   5. No loose or baggy clothing that can snag on tools or robots.
   6. Long hair must be tied back to prevent entanglement.  Please provide your own hair ties.
   7. Long earrings, neckties, bracelets, and dangling necklaces are not safe in the shop.  Large rings are not recommended in machine shops.
   8. When working in the shop, gloves are to be used only to lift sharp, hot, or excessively dirty objects.  Do not use gloves around the machines or robots!
   9. No long sleeves, skirts, shorts, tank tops, spaghetti straps, low-riding pants, loose jacket/hoodie strings, or low-cut cleavage shirts.  These outfits are not only inappropriate in a shop, but they also increase the chances of injury due to metal shavings, entanglement, and tool sparks.
3 - Shop and Tool Safety
   1. Adults and students are not allowed to work alone in the shop at any time.
   2. The CNC, Lathe, and Mill areas are restricted to reduce traffic.
   3. Every time the shop is used, it must be fully cleaned by the team using it before leaving.
   4. No food or drink in the shop or robot areas.
   5. No headphones, AirPods, or loud music
   6. ALWAYS ASK. If you do not know how to operate a tool or the tool is behaving strangely, inform a mentor to get further instructions.
   7. Never try to halt a machine in motion by hand
   8. Always put tools back where they belong.  If you are unsure, ask around until the tool can go back properly.
   9. Clean up all chips, dust, debris, loose fasteners, parts, and tooling around your work areas before leaving.
   10. Do not leave tooling in the machines!
   11. Do not remove saw blades from any saw.
   12. Always properly clamp work pieces using a vise or fixturing clamps before drilling, cutting, tapping, etc.
   13. If you see a broken or missing tool, please inform a mentor immediately so we can replace the tool.
   14. Use a mask when cutting carbon fibers, fiberglass, lead, or fuming plastics.
   15. Do not inhale torch gases or fumes from plastics when cutting.
   16. Do not look at welding arcs when welding is in progress, this requires a welding face shield even if you are far away.
   17. Do not use a tool with a severed electrical cable, inform a mentor so that it can be repaired.
   18. Always wrap electrical terminals with electrical tape only.
   19. Always leave machines in a safe state when finished.  Unplug tools, clean them, no tooling or parts left in the machines, do not leave chuck keys in the spindles, don't leave tools on the ground, etc.
   20. Do not store tools or heavy/sharp objects in tall places.
4 - Robot Safety
   1. Know your robot cell! This is the distance the robot can reach in one second with any part or projectile.
   2. Caution! Robots can shoot projectiles by design or by accident.
   3. Before operating a robot, please get a briefing on its capabilities.
   4. Beware of pinch points and dead loads on the robots that can injure you in motion or during transport.
   5. Make sure the robot is powered off before working on electrical or mechanical subsystems.
   6. Some repairs require the robot to be on or enabled.  Please refer to the RSL (Robot Signal Light) to achieve safe repairs.  Blinking means ENABLED. Solid means DISABLED.
   7. If operating a robot, announce you are enabling it loudly and clearly to let others know the robot could move.
   8. Disabling a robot can be achieved with the ENTER key on the driver station or the SPACE BAR for forced E-STOP.
   9. Extra care must be taken when operating the robot in Autonomous mode. Prepare to disable immediately when testing.
   10. Never operate the robot near unaware people or small children who are approaching the robot.
   11. Use extra caution at events using the robot.
   12. Always inspect the robot before driving it.
   13. Never operate the robot in less than prime condition.  If you hear bad noises or strange sounds coming from the robot, this could indicate expensive damage to the gearboxes. 
   14. Most robots have pneumatics that must be vented to the atmosphere when the robot is done being driven.
   15. Never leave a robot or robot driver station enabled and unattended.
   16. Robots may only be driven under mentor supervision and when students know how the robot operates.
   17. Always use two people to lift robots.
   18. Tall robots are awkward to carry, coordinate lifting with a  3, 2, 1 - lift sequence.
   19. Do not try to stop falling or wayward robots from moving - get clear.
   20. Always store and transport batteries with the safety plug in the Anderson Connector. Only unplug the safety plug to charge or use the battery in the robot.
   21. A ruptured robot battery is a serious hazard! Tell students and mentors immediately, and use a battery spill kit.  Toss the battery in the 5-gallon bucket, dump the kitty litter on top, and seal the bucket lid.
   22. Do not carry robot batteries by cables!
5 - Tournament Rules and Safety
   1. No running in the pits or event venue!
   2. No saving seats, this is against the FRC code of conduct.
   3. Do not sleep or play video games in the stands.
   4. Do not leave a mess in the stands or lunch area. The team always cleans our area up before we leave.
   5. Do not throw airplanes or other projectiles at competitions.
   6. Do not bring loud noise makers to competitions.
   7. Do not jeer or boo from the crowd at any time in FRC.
   8. Do not leave early from the event venue.  Each team should stay until the end for the awards ceremony.
   9. DO NOT step over field barriers.  This will instantly result in a Yellow Card.
   10. Do not bring cell phones out on the field of play.
   11. Hotspots are heavily frowned upon at competitions by FRC staff.  They use Wi-Fi sniffers at competitions to discourage this.
   12. Do not discuss match strategy unless the Drive Coach is present. If absent, find the drive coach.
   13. During the competition, Judges in blue shirts will talk to team members.  YETI schedules team members to be in our pit at all times for these Judging conversations.
   14. The Mechanical Manager oversees the pit and designates the Safety Captain badge holder at competitions.
   15. Team members are not allowed in the pit unless they are scheduled to be present.
   16. The pit breaker switch must be turned off before departing the venue each day at competitions.
   17. All tools must be plugged in via the singular pit power source.
   18. There are amperage limits in competition that disallow high current devices like heat guns and compressors.
   19. All wires must be tucked or taped in the pit to prevent tripping hazards.
   20. Nothing is allowed to be stored on the floor of the pit.  All personal items must be stored away from the pit.
   21. Parts and tools must be organized prior to departing the venue each evening.
   22. Only water in sealed containers is allowed in the competition pit.
   23. Competitions require a checklist for loading up so that nothing is forgotten.
   24. Battery management is extremely important in competitions.  Do not move batteries unless the Technician allows it.
   25. Batteries must be cycled and tested before competition. No old batteries are to be used.
   26. Only one robot is allowed in the venue! No practice robots are allowed.
   27. Do not lend out tools for other teams to borrow unless you accompany the tool to the pit of the borrower and get it back immediately.
   28. Safety Advisors are often walking the pits at competition, please be respectful as these volunteers can also issue Yellow/Red cards.
6 - Travel/Hotel Rules and Safety
   1. Team members will not leave the facility during tournament times unless for an emergency or specific situation which has been communicated and approved by one of the lead mentors.
   2. Do not leave the tournaments early, it is disrespectful, and often enough, students who leave early miss out on awards.
   3. Do not take Uber rides unless escorted by a mentor or parent.
   4. No adults will stay in rooms with students unless parent/child.
   5. Lights out at 10 pm.
   6. No usage of the hotel pool or gym equipment is permitted.
   7. No students will be in the rooms designated for the opposite sex or rooms not assigned to them.
   8. Students may meet in the hotel lobby area for social activity, not in hotel rooms.
   9. Students will not leave the hotel without a lead mentor's approval.
   10. Respect travel departure times.  Arrive on time for meals, carpools, and bus rides.
   11. No student will stay behind at the hotel unless expressly allowed by a lead mentor.
   12. Report any damage to the hotel to a lead mentor, or you will be charged for the damage.


7 - Discord and Communication Policies
   1. The team uses Discord as a major communication channel for the team.  All safety rules and expectations apply to online communication while on the team.
   2. No creating private group chats - multiperson communication should occur in the appropriate channels in the server in accordance with our two deep rule.
   3. If a student wishes to raise a concern, they should use the automated modmail bot in Discord. This bot allows for anonymous concern reporting directly to the mentor group as a whole or you can identify as a specific team member in that communication.
   
   Direct Messages should be limited to the following situations:
   1. Mentors should not have reasons to DM students except to request private in person meetings with parents or other mentors
   2. Students reaching out for personal feedback or recommendations
   3. Conversations should be limited to a few messages before mentor requests to move to the main server or an in person discussion with another mentor present
   
   Crucial Conversations:
   1. Sometimes a concern will arise from a student or mentor that should be addressed immediately. We call this a “Crucial Conversation”.  
   2. This verbiage can be utilized to request an immediate audience with a mentor.  This can be with 2 mentors or 2 students and one mentor to address high priority topics, concerns, safety, or even topics of high emotional importance.

About the Team 
FRC 3506 YETI Robotics started in 2010 at CPCC with 17 students and met with early success.  YETI expanded the team from 17 students to about 25 in 2012 and held this team size until about 2015.  In 2014, with 30 students, YETI formed the Queen City Robotics Alliance (QCRA) with other FIRST teams and moved into the FIRST Zone Charlotte at the airport, a 10,000 square foot robot facility built out of an old maintenance facility.  For those few years, the team soared in performance and impact in the Charlotte region.  With the airport looming to retake the facility and YETI looking for a place to call home in 2018, QCRA moved to the 900 Pressley Road facility and forged a partnership with TPM.  Under this partnership, the FIRST Zone Charlotte thrived, and YETI has grown to over 70 students.  In the 2024 season, YETI moved to 2102 Cambridge Beltway Drive Suite B, Charlotte, NC, their 4th home, a state-of-the-art facility built for FIRST programs under the Queen City Robotics Alliance!
YETI's first regional was the 2011 North Carolina Regional, where the team won the Rookie Inspiration Award and earned a spot on the 2nd-seeded alliance going into the elimination bracket.  This alliance went on undefeated to win the NC regional and a ticket to the 2011 World Championships in St. Louis, MO.  This made YETI Robotics the first NC team to win the NC Regional!
Since 2011, YETI has had many successes, including seven championship plays, 16 Blue Banner titles, and over 40 Awards.  By 2016, YETI Robotics was the undisputed State Champion of North Carolina after a three-title sweep for the state Championship (Chairman's, Winner, WFFA).  The team has continued this history of excellence by winning the Chairman's Award again in 2018 at the NC State Championship!
        Through 2019-2021, YETI was able to maintain a steady program through the pandemic and make competitive robots with as few as four students in the space in a single meeting to meet regulations.  In 2022, with pandemic regulations gone, YETI continues to be an unstoppable force as an outreach focused powerhouse, winning events, Engineering Inspiration, and a consecutive State Championship Impact Award victory in 2024 and 2025.

1 - Team Structure
Student Leads: Our team is student-driven, and our student leaders work together to run the team smoothly and make sure team goals are met promptly. 
Mentors: Mentors encourage and enable students to be innovators. They help students develop their leadership and problem-solving abilities, but more significantly, their sense of community and self-assurance. 
Rookies: These members are new to the FRC program and often explore all of the subsystems before finding one or two that interest them the most. Our team has plenty of resources for our rookie members to learn, grow, and find what they are most interested in. 
Veterans: These are members who are experienced in FRC. These members will have at least 1 year of experience, making them more comfortable with the program and a guiding figure to many of the rookies.
________________


2 - Team Captains
There are two team captains on the team: the Business Captain and the Engineering Captain; the responsibilities and requirements of each are extensive, and in general, they ensure the efficient operation of both sides of the team. 
3 - Mechanical/Safety Team
The mechanical/safety sub-team is responsible for the design and build of the robot. Robot archetypes and ideas are first prototyped and tested before moving to CAD. With thorough designs, sponsors and in-shop machines can fabricate parts that aid in the construction of the robot. Sub-assemblies are made to work with each other, be built easily, and complement other sub-teams. Each year, a new drive train is specialized based on the game's needs. To achieve the goals set during strategy meetings, parts are prototyped, improved, and iterated, ending with a final product that is competition-ready. 
4 - Controls Team
The controls sub-team is split into our electrical team and the programming team. Our electrical team is responsible for laying down all of our wiring, as well as our pneumatic systems and any other special components (driver camera, Limelight, etc.). They create wiring diagrams and work with the CAD team to ensure that our structural design will allow for easy access to electronic components. The programming team makes the robot assembled by the mechanical and electrical sub-teams come alive. They use advanced control theory to make both autonomous control and driver operation as smooth as possible. 
5 - Marketing Team
The marketing sub-team makes sure that our team is recognized and maintains an active position in the local community while being the greatest example of gracious professionalism that we can be. This is accomplished through our social media, newsletters to sponsors, and website branding. This sub-team is responsible for filming and documenting the team in action at demos, events, and competitions. Marketing helps team members strengthen their public speaking and presenting skills and ensures the team's success in applying for awards and preparing information for the Impact and Engineering Inspiration Award(s). They also assist in editing the Judge's and Engineering Notebook(s) and make sure that YETI is always putting its best foot forward. 
6 - Finance Team
The finance sub-team is responsible for managing all sources of income, such as fundraising, grants, and donations. Every year, there are two fundraising classes provided for everyone, rookie or veteran, so they can meet their goal of $1,750 MINIMUM. The finance manager utilizes the money raised from our expenses for the robot, zone, shop, outreach, and competition/travel. 
Finance also helps and oversees all students in their efforts to secure sponsors and submit for the Team Sustainability Award. 
7 - Strategy and Scouting
The strategy sub-team is responsible for creating ideas for the robot during build season. During competition, the scouting sub-team will create shifts for all students to scout unless told otherwise. Then, scouting and strategy get together and prepare for alliance selections the next day. The engineering captain or scouting lead is responsible for being the alliance captain. 
8 - Drive Team
This team is responsible for driving the robot at competitions. It consists of the technician, primary driver, secondary driver, and human player. They are responsible for many on-field operations and will often be working closely with the strategy team and pit crew. You will have to try out before the competition to get one of these positions. 
The Primary Driver controls the movement of the robot around the field, and occasionally key mechanisms such as shooting. 
The Secondary Driver uses various buttons to control the robot's appendages, such as elevators or intakes, to make the robot pick up and score game pieces.
The Human Player handles game pieces throughout the match. Their role can vary depending on the game. 
The Technician pulls the robot cart, keeps track of batteries, and helps with setup and robot repairs. They are not allowed to interact with the robot during the match. 
9 - Rookie-Eligible Roles
All rookie-eligible roles require 75% attendance (of 390 total), and 50 hours per season of outreach. They include: 
Mechanical Subsystem Manager - who focuses on the entirety of mechanical-related tasks for a single subsystem, such as the elevator or intake. 
Robot Engineer - focuses on the CAD and technical skills necessary to mechanically build the robot. 
Graphic Illustrator - who creates a variety of marketing-related media, and requires proficiency in Adobe InDesign/Photoshop. 
Awards/Writer - who creates applications, scripts, and other items necessary for marketing or awards. 
Website/Historian - who keeps the website and calendar updated and in good condition. 
Photographer/Videographer Lead - leads a team of photographers/videographers to gather pictures AND VIDEOS of outreach and competitions (must be uploaded to Google Drive). 
Electrical Engineer (CAD Designer) - oversees electrical and pneumatic work in the shop and designs Electrical and Pneumatic Schematics and Panel Layout (requires a strong knowledge of basic electrical concepts).
Electrical/Panel Builder - who builds, installs, and maintains the electrical and pneumatic components based on Electrical Schematics and Layout drawings (requires basic use of hand, test, and measurement tools and basic electrical/wiring knowledge). 
Robot Programmer - who designs computer vision algorithms, develops the Java robot program, and creates and maintains program documentation (must be able to write code in Java or be willing to learn, and understand IntelliJ IDEA, SourceTree, and GitHub). 
Scouting Site Developer - who communicates with Strategy team to develop scouting form and display of data and maintains the site before, during, and between competitions (requires experience in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Typescript, Angular, Java, and MySQL or be willing to learn and understanding of IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, SourceTree, and GitHub) 
Scouting Manager - who makes the scouting schedule for every competition and ensures people adhere to it. They should be able to adjust the scouting schedule, review and provide feedback on scouting data, and be able to answer any questions scouters may have (requires attendance at all competitions and a strong understanding of the game). 
Subsystem Controls Manager - focuses on the entirety of controls-related tasks for a single subsystem, such as the elevator or intake.

How does YETI build robots?
1 - Design Philosophy
Defined goals - Obviously, every team wants to build the best robot they can; however, this “best” is defined differently based on the goals the team has. As the goal changes the best possible robot to achieve said goals also changes. This is why immediately after kickoff, YETI's strategy team conducts a thorough game analysis and constructs a list of priorities (ranked in order of importance). 
The best design wins - The design that is effectively demonstrated to function most efficiently is the one that will make it on the robot. “Effectively” refers to the degree of proof of functionality of the design. Two different designs can be very competitive; however, the one drawn on a paper napkin will lose to the one fully prototyped and designed in CAD. 
“Efficiently” refers to being most functional while being the least complicated. 
Prototyping and CAD - As mentioned before, these are essential to YETI's design philosophy. Prototyping is constructing a design out of quick-access materials in such a way that is demonstrative of the effectiveness of the final design. CAD is the essential step in the design process, where every detail must be constructed in SolidWorks before actually going on the robot or being constructed out of final materials. 
________________


2 - Strategic Design
Designing around key elements of the predicted game strategy. 
Basic Strategy - Can analyze the game rules and predict the strategies and robot archetypes that will be the most effective throughout the entire season. 
Foresight - The game itself can change with rule changes, and game strategy also develops through the course of the season. Being able to predict these and incorporate them is extremely advantageous. 
Ranking Points - Ranking points dictate seeding for teams before alliance selection, so they increase the chance of being on a top alliance and therefore winning. 
Thinking outside of the box - Typically, all robots in a year look very similar as they are designed for the same game. So how can a robot be better than the rest? With a design that no other team has thought of, sometimes the most unusual ideas are the best. 
Adaptability - Designing with the intent of possible changes to the robot. 
Repairability - Designing with the intent to prevent damage to key components and fix damage when it occurs.

3 - Achieving Excellence
Chase perfection and achieve excellence on the way. The robot is never done, not even at the last competition of the season. Constantly thinking about how to improve the design of the robot is integral to our design philosophy. YETI pursues the best version of the robot for the entire length of the season through constant iteration. 
How do we impact the community?
1 - Marketing and Branding
Mission Statement: YETI Robotics aims to foster STEM education in the seven-county region of Charlotte, North Carolina, and its surrounding suburbs by developing, offering, and backing a variety of training to student robotics teams, hosting robotics events, and engineering programs for students of all ages.

4 - Outreach
YETI's high emphasis on outreach means that every student's participation is critical in ensuring that events run smoothly. Each student must contribute to outreach (rookies need to have 50 hours and veterans 100 hours), totaling over 8,000 team hours over the year. Outreach events include events hosted by local companies, demoing the robot at community events, and partnering with nonprofit organizations. From gaining experience by interacting with industry professionals to helping introduce younger children to STEM, students not only improve their own skills but also contribute to the wider community. By putting great emphasis on outreach, YETI is able to directly give back to our local and global communities. 
Some of our events for the upcoming season include: 
   * RISE with YETI: A free program focused on bringing uniquely tailored after school STEM robotics opportunities to underserved areas 
   * First Lego League (FLL) and First Tech Challenge (FTC) Mentoring: This year, we are mentoring 1 FLL Explore Team, 6 FLL Challenge teams, and 8 FTC teams. 
   * Cybersecurity Classes at Senior Homes: To protect senior citizens from cyber threats, YETI presents technology, plays games, and hosts other activities at senior homes. 
   * Boy Scouts: One of our newer initiatives is to instruct Boy Scouts in receiving their Robotics merit badges, instructing them in robot design, helping them try practical skills, and inviting them to our robotics competition to see robotics in action. 
   * Girl Scouts: YETIs have mentored Girl Scouts for the last 6 years in basic robotics with Lego EV3s to help them earn their merit badges. 
   * General Demos and Presentations
5 - Impact Metrics
Last season, we completed over 2600 hours of outreach, more than 24 demos, and impacted over 28,000 people.

How do competitions work?
1 - Game Design
FIRST FRC game website 
   1. Every year, FIRST reveals a new game with new rules and goals, but some aspects of the game remain the same: 
   1. Autonomous period: the first 15 seconds of the match, teams are not allowed to operate their robot and must rely on a preprogrammed path. Often, all accomplishments made during this period are valued higher than regular play 
   2. Teleop period: after the initial 15 seconds of the match expire, teams have the remaining 2 minutes 30 seconds to control their robot to earn points 
Quick facts: 
   * Matches last 2 minutes 45 seconds 
   * Every teammate should download the rules of that year's game from FIRST's website (found above) 
   * With every game comes a reveal video, which can help visualize game mechanics
   * Rules are subject to change by FIRST up until a little before the world championships 
   * Field items are available to download from FIRST's website for detailed drawings

3 - Travel to Competitions
   1. Most competitions require overnight stays (see 6- Travel/Hotel Rules and Safety); every teammate is responsible for their ride there and back, although some mentors and parents can give students a ride. We strongly encourage parents to be there, especially at the State Championship, due to the distance to the competition venues and to assist with lunch/dinner distribution and chaperoning a big team. 
   2. Requirements for going to the competition can be found in 2 - Fees and Fundraising Requirements


________________
How does YETI run as a business entity?
1 - Finances
   1. Each year, YETI's robot build typically costs around $10,000/robot. To allow access to the robot for both the mechanical and programming teams, we built two robots. This allows all YETI members to be directly engaged with the robots and provides greater flexibility when a robot is required for a non-competition event. This doubles our total robot costs to roughly $30,000-35,500, including spares. 
   2. Annually, YETI attends 2 district competitions and has always qualified for the State Championship as well. Each competition involves shirt, marketing, registration, hotel, and dinner costs for the season. See the budget below.
   3. As YETI operates out of the Zone with other FIRST teams, we pay rent to use the space and store our tools and robots there. We, along with other teams and the Queen City Robotics Alliance, contribute to paying the rent and utility costs of operating the portion of the space, which totals $63,984/year.
   4. Each year, we aim to raise more money than our projected expenses; in case we have a budget surplus, we fund more robot development projects and outreach. For example, having raised more money than we spent for the 2021-2022 season, we were able to build an extra robot using a swerve drive during the off-season to work with that technology and train rookies.
  

2 - Business plan
Income 
YETI receives income primarily through three sources: registration, sponsorship, and grants. Each student is required to pay a $300 registration fee (and get it matched if possible) to join the team; at 60 members, we acquire about $18,000 (and potentially $36,000 with matches) from registration. That is why it is critical to fundraise the minimum, and each student is responsible for raising that $1750 for the team, in addition to their registration fee. This can be acquired through corporate sponsorship, parents' employer volunteer hours, or matching. We provide extensive resources to help team members raise money, including classes, email templates, and a script for calling potential sponsors. We work to ensure that finances are not a barrier for any student's membership on YETI. Many students end up raising upwards of $2000 for the team. We have several sponsors that have supported our team for multiple years and are constantly working to increase their interest to retain support season after season. We do ask that if any parents have contacts at local companies to please reach out to Mrs. I, and share those.  If you will be paying COMPLETELY OUT OF POCKET, do not forget you will be asked to pay $2500.
3 - Sustainability
Sustainability is a top priority even with a reputable team. YETI is at its largest this season, growing from 8 members in 2020 to 66 in 2023 and roughly 85 for the 2024-2025 season. This presents both the opportunity of expanding team initiatives and the challenge of engaging everyone. Embracing this growth, we built two robots and are expanding our community involvement during the build season, preparing all our members to become leaders in YETI and STEM. 
Our team's sustainability is built on passionate student involvement. Through our student-led Java training, fundraising classes, and SolidWorks online training, our members grow into future leaders together, advancing their skill sets, creating confidence, and encouraging the student-teacher mentality. This continuous cycle of passing down knowledge and skills needed to lead events and projects, along with documentation of our process, creates a sustainable team model for growth and expansion. 


How do I make an Impact? What do I do at YETI?
1 - As a team
   * Long Term Outreach: Although creating the robot is an important aspect of the FIRST program, the best way our team can make a significant impact on our community is through outreach, and specifically, some of our long-term outreach projects. Outreach Initiatives such as Girl Scouts, after-school Programs, Rise with YETI, and Prepare have impacted so many different schools and communities globally. As a team, we need to continue to push boundaries and reach more people all around the world. 
   * FIRST Pipeline: By starting, sponsoring, mentoring, and assisting FIRST teams all across North Carolina we can sustain this amazing program, impacting more curious students with a passion for business and STEM. 
   * Spreading STEM Opportunities: Through each of our outreach events, we spread STEM throughout our community. We impact a range of people from kindergarten to senior citizens. 
2 - As an individual
   * Be Committed: You get out what you put into the program. That means that to be successful on this team, in competition, and life, you have to give it your 100 percent and more! 
   * Show Up: On YETI, we have an attendance requirement; however, to get the best experience on the team, you must come and participate a lot more than what is required. We understand if you need to miss a few meetings here and there, but to make a real impact on the team, you must be present! 
   * Attendance: signing in and signing out
   * Learn: On YETI, we give you a variety of resources to be successful and learn. Our Java classes, SolidWorks lessons, and Fundraising sessions are just the beginning of all the ways this team can help you grow! We also have several knowledgeable mentors who guide us through the program. 
   * Have Fun: Once a YETI, always a YETI! Our team bond is strong, and outside of robotics, we do a lot of team-building activities and events. Remember to always have fun! 
3 - At competitions
   * Show Gracious Professionalism: The FIRST ethos includes gracious professionalism. It's a method of operating that promotes excellent work, highlights the importance of others, and respects people and the community. As a team, we must show gracious professionalism throughout the competition. 
   * Be Respectful: Respect is extremely important. During competitions, Judges can be anywhere, and every single person on the team must carry themself with respect. This means being respectful to volunteers, referees, judges and other teams. 
   * Focus: Make sure to always be focused on the tasks at hand. Remember that our team has worked months on our robot and years on our outreach, so we need to be focused when it counts!
   * Roles: Pit scouting, mascot, helping teams
4 - At outreach events
   * Be Engaged: Whether you are volunteering in an afterschool STEM program, a demo, or Girls Scouts class, make sure you are engaged and participating. You can only make an impact if you are present. 
   * Communicate: Make sure to always come to outreach events ON TIME. If there is an emergency and you cannot make it, make sure to let the Team Lead or a mentor know 48 hours before the event, and find a replacement for yourself. Communication is extremely important, and you need to make sure you are communicating with your mentors and team members effectively.
